# Enhancing CI/CD Workflows with Design Patterns in Python for Beginners

### PyCon Sweden 2024

This repository demonstrates an approach to building robust, scalable, and maintainable Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines using design patterns in Python, specifically tailored for beginners.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to improve the CI/CD process by applying essential software design patterns within CI/CD workflows. By adopting these patterns, this project aims to enhance:

- **Robustness**: Increased resilience to errors and smooth handling of pipeline failures
- **Maintainability**: Simplified updates and changes to pipeline configurations
- **Scalability**: Optimized structure to support larger and more complex deployments
- **Reusability**: Modular design patterns to minimize redundancy across pipelines

This repo demonstrates the use of **Python-based design patterns** in Azure to achieve these goals.

## Project Highlights

- **Built on Azure**: All configurations and examples are optimized for deployment in Azure environments.
- **Design Patterns Applied**: Code examples showcase design patterns such as  **Strategy**, **Observer** etc. to improve CI/CD structures.
- **Step-by-Step Documentation**: Includes a clear, beginner-friendly explanation of how each design pattern is implemented and how it enhances the CI/CD process.
