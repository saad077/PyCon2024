The main issue causing the application failure is a deliberate and simulated exception in the `log_generator` function. This exception is manually raised with the message "Unknown exception occurred" at line 58 in the file `/mnt/c/Users/shasan/Desktop/pycon/demand-ai/src/app.py`. The error is consistently logged, indicating it is not due to an unexpected bug but is intentionally triggered for testing or debugging purposes. To prevent the application failure, you can either remove or modify the code that raises this exception, depending on whether the simulated error is still required for testing.
